  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    For centuries mathematicians searched for general formulas that could solve polynomial equations.
    Methods for quadratics, cubics and quartics all succeeded by reducing the equations to expressions
    involving roots. These early successes led to the expectation that a similar method should exist
    for the quintic. Abel proved this was impossible and Galois later explained why by showing that
    solvability depends on the structure of the permutations of the roots. When these permutations
    can be broken into simple layers, as in lower-degree equations, a formula can be built. The quintic
    fails because its permutation group, S<sub>5</sub>, has no such structure. Its internal organisation
    prevents any sequence of algebraic steps from matching the behaviour of its roots. This article explores
    the ideas behind this barrier and shows how Galois theory provides a structural explanation for the
    failure of a quintic formula.

  <div id="Introduction_InText">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The pursuit for general methods to solve polynomial equations has been a key component of mathematics
      for centuries. The quadratic formula, which may come across as trivial today, represented major progress
      for mathematicians such as al-Khwarizmi, and later work by Cardano and others in the sixteenth century
      produced general formulas for cubic and quartic equations (Burton, 2011). This common trend suggested
      that higher-degree equations should follow the same pattern. If degrees two, three and four had
      closed-form solutions, it seemed natural to assume a similar method for the fifth degree. Yet every
      attempt to extend existing techniques failed. As Bruns (2020) observes, this history shows “why formulae
      exist for equations of degree four or less … and why they do not for degree five or more”.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift in algebra was that familiar methods were no longer the right tool to solve higher order
      polynomials. Progress required focusing on the structure of the roots rather than manipulating the
      equation directly. This leads to the central idea behind Galois theory: the way the roots of a polynomial
      can be rearranged, while still preserving algebraic relationships, determines whether a formula using
      radicals can exist (Stewart, 2015). To see why the fifth-degree case behaves differently, it helps to
      first understand why the earlier formulas were possible.

    <h2 id="why-early">Why the Early Formulas Worked</h2>
    <p>
      Early mathematicians could explain the earlier successes but the same approach failed once they moved
      to the fifth degree. With quadratics, completing the square lets you isolate the root in a straightforward
      way. For cubic and quartic equations, the methods developed by del Ferro, Tartaglia and Cardano turned
      the problems into forms where the roots could still be written using basic operations and familiar root
      expressions. The links between the roots stayed simple enough to handle. Even when the working became
      longer, you could still reach the roots using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square
      or cube roots. This level of structure is what made general formulas possible for degrees two to four.
    </p>

    <h2 id="abel-ruffini">The Abel–Ruffini Theorem</h2>
    <p>
      The difficulty with the fifth degree comes from the way the roots of a quintic polynomial relate to
      one another. For lower degrees, each method relies on reducing the equation to a simpler form that
      eventually leads to square or cube roots. This reduction works because the relationships between the
      roots can be controlled and expressed through those operations. With quintic polynomials, this reduction
      step breaks down. Approaches such as trying to remove certain terms or constructing auxiliary equations
      no longer produce expressions that depend only on roots of simpler polynomials. The connections between
      the five roots become too intricate to be captured through repeated use of square or cube roots. Abel
      proved this by showing that no sequence of algebraic steps can rearrange a general quintic into a form
      where the roots can be written using a finite combination of arithmetic operations and root extractions
      (Stillwell, 2010). This explained why earlier attempts failed and showed that the obstacle was rooted in
      fifth-degree polynomials rather than in the methods used.

      A permutation is simply a way of reordering the roots of a polynomial while keeping track of which root
      moves to which position. Even a basic quadratic shows how this works. A quadratic has two roots; you can
      list them as [r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>], so there are only two possible arrangements. Both lists contain
      the same numbers and the equation keeps all its algebraic relationships. As the degree increases, the
      number of possible rearrangements grows sharply, as shown in Table 1. Thinking of root behaviour in this
      way reveals that each polynomial comes with its own set of allowable permutations and understanding this
      set forms the starting point of Galois’s approach.
    </p>

    <h2 id="solvable-groups">Solvable Groups and Why They Matter</h2>
    <p>
      The cubic is a good place to see how Galois’s ideas connect to an actual formula. A cubic has three roots
      and the six ways to rearrange them form a group that contains a few smaller, simpler patterns. Some of
      these rearrangements just cycle the roots and others swap two of them. These smaller patterns sit inside
      the full group in a way that mirrors how the cubic formula is built. When you solve a cubic, you first
      form a square-root expression and then use that result inside a cube root. Each step depends on the one
      before it, which matches the ordered structure inside its permutation group. This is what Galois meant by
      a solvable group: the symmetries can be broken into stages that line up with the steps in a root-based
      formula (Stewart, 2015).
    </p>

    <h2 id="quintic-barrier">The Group Structure Behind the Quintic Barrier</h2>
    <p>
      The difficulty with the quintic comes from how its root permutations organise themselves. The five roots
      can be rearranged in one hundred and twenty different ways and the group formed by these permutations,
      called S<sub>5</sub>, contains all of them. The key issue is that the permutations in S<sub>5</sub> cannot
      be arranged into a chain of smaller subgroups that naturally follow one another. In group theory terms,
      there is no sequence of subgroups where each one is normal in the next and where the quotients are simple
      enough to match the operations used in root-based formulas. In S<sub>5</sub>, the first non-trivial normal
      subgroup is the alternating group A<sub>5</sub>, which is simple, meaning it cannot be broken down any
      further. Because this structure stops at A<sub>5</sub>, there is no step-by-step path through the group that
      matches the layers needed to build an expression from square or cube roots. This is why no general formula
      for the quintic can exist.

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The search for general formulas for polynomial equations followed a clear pattern in the lower degrees,
    where the structure of the roots allowed the equations to be reduced in stages. This pattern breaks at the
    quintic. Abel showed that no sequence of algebraic steps can reshape a general fifth-degree equation into a
    form built from simple root expressions. Galois explained why, by linking solvability to the structure of the
    permutations of the roots. The group S<sub>5</sub> has no layers that match the steps of a root-based formula,
    which is why the quintic has no general solution.
